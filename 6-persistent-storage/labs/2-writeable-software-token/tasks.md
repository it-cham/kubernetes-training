## Lab: Software Token Management

### Current challenges with read-only configuration

Looking at typical enterprise application requirements:

- **Configuration Source**: Software tokens and licenses start in ConfigMaps or Secrets
- **Runtime Modification**: Applications need to modify tokens (usage tracking, token refresh)
- **Persistence Required**: Token modifications must survive pod restarts
- **Read-Only Problem**: ConfigMaps and Secrets are read-only when mounted as volumes

### Your Tasks

1. **Create initial token configuration** using ConfigMaps for non-sensitive token data
2. **Implement PersistentVolumeClaim** for writable token storage
3. **Design InitContainer pattern** to copy tokens from read-only to writable storage
4. **Deploy application** that can read and modify tokens at runtime
5. **Test token persistence** across pod restarts and scaling scenarios
6. **Implement advanced patterns** for multiple tokens and validation
7. **Validate the complete workflow** from initialization to runtime modification

### Challenge Questions

- Why can't applications directly write to ConfigMap-mounted volumes?
- How does the InitContainer pattern solve the read-only configuration problem?
- What's the data flow from ConfigMap through InitContainer to the main application?
- How do you ensure token modifications persist across pod restarts?
- What are the security considerations when handling writable tokens?

### Success Criteria

- [ ] Initial tokens loaded from ConfigMaps into writable storage
- [ ] InitContainer successfully copies tokens to PVC-backed volume
- [ ] Main application can read and modify tokens at runtime
- [ ] Token modifications persist across pod restarts
- [ ] Multiple token files handled correctly
- [ ] Proper file permissions set on writable tokens
- [ ] Application demonstrates token usage tracking
- [ ] Storage resources properly configured and bound
- [ ] No sensitive data exposed in container logs
- [ ] Pattern works for both single and multiple token scenarios
