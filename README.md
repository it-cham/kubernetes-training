# Kubernetes Training

A comprehensive hands-on training program that guides you from container and Docker basics to advanced Kubernetes concepts and operations.

## Overview

This training is designed for developers, DevOps engineers, and system administrators who want to master containerization and Kubernetes orchestration. It follows a progressive learning path from foundational container concepts to production-ready Kubernetes deployments.

## Learning Path

### Phase 1: Container Fundamentals

- Docker installation and configuration
- Container lifecycle management
- Container networking fundamentals
- Volume management and data persistence
- Docker Compose for multi-container applications
- Advanced Docker concepts and optimization

### Phase 2: Kubernetes Foundation

- Kubernetes architecture and components
- Container orchestration concepts
- Setting up local development environment with k3s/Rancher Desktop
- Prerequisites and environment preparation

### Phase 3: Kubernetes Operations

- kubectl command-line interface
- Basic cluster operations and management
- Working with Kubernetes resources

## Prerequisites

### System Requirements

- **Operating System**: Windows 10/11, macOS, or Linux
- **Hardware**: 4GB RAM minimum (8GB recommended), 20GB free disk space
- **Network**: Internet connection for downloading images and packages

### Required Software

- **Rancher Desktop**: Lightweight Kubernetes distribution with k3s
- **Docker**: Container runtime (can be configured during Rancher Desktop setup)
- **Terminal/Shell**: Enhanced shell setup recommended (see [Shell Setup Guide](common/setup-shell.md))

## Getting Started

### 1. Environment Setup

Follow the [Shell Setup Guide](common/setup-shell.md) to configure your development environment with:

- Modern terminal with Kubernetes context display
- Essential tools and utilities
- Shell enhancements for productivity

### 2. Install Rancher Desktop

Download and install [Rancher Desktop](https://rancherdesktop.io/) with these configurations:

- **Container Runtime**: Docker or containerd (recommended)
- **Kubernetes**: k3s distribution
- **Traefik**: Disable (will be installed separately if needed)

### 3. Verify Installation

```bash
# Check Docker installation
docker --version

# Check Kubernetes cluster
kubectl cluster-info

# List cluster nodes
kubectl get nodes
```
