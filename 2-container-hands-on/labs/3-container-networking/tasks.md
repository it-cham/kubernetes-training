## Lab 3: Container Networking & Communication

### Your Tasks

1. Create two containers and make them communicate using IP addresses
2. Set up containers that can communicate using container names
3. Create network isolation between different groups of containers
4. Build a "gateway" container that can reach multiple networks

### Challenge Questions

- Why can't containers communicate by name on the default network?
- How do you prevent containers from reaching each other?
- What's the difference between default and custom networks?

### Success Criteria

- [ ] Containers can ping each other by name (not just IP)
- [ ] Network isolation prevents unauthorized communication
- [ ] Multi-network container can reach both networks
